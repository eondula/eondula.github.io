            Elizabeth's research is in reinforcement learning, specifically its application to scenarios for optimizing decision-making strategies under uncertainties. Her current work integrates stochastic epidemic modeling with reinforcement learning, addressing complexities in educational settings during epidemics. Apart from reinforcement learning, she delves into intelligent autonomy, human-AI interaction, multi-agent systems, and AI tool design and development.
